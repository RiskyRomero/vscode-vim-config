### VSCode Vim Config
Use VSCode like it's Neovim, or just use [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) for the smooth cursor.

# Requirements
- Install the [Vim Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) for VSCode.
- Backup your `keybindings.json` and `settings.json`, or create a new profile in case my config is not to your liking.
